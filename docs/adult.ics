By Scott Richards Follow Discover a game-changing strategy to conquer debt without spending more each month! Location Fredericksburg 123 Main St Fredericksburg\, VA 22401 Get directions Good to know Highlights In person Highlights In person About this event Business • Finance Do you owe money to any creditors? Are you working to pay off debts like a mortgage\, maybe a student loan\, a car loan\, or credit cards? Are the never-ending payments creating immense stress and anxiety in your life? Would having zero debt provide you with peace of mind and a less stressful life? Of course it would\, then you need to do something about it! We have a plan that gets you out of debt faster than the way you’re currently paying your bills\, and we’d like to share it with you. It’s free to see\, and no obligation to do anything Register and in the confirmation email will be a link to the information that describes the program. This is NOT credit consolidation\, debt relief or anything that affects your credit. You’ll still pay off your debts\, but using a modified snowball approach. You can usually do it much faster than just paying extra on your debt. We’ll show you how\, without changing your monthly spend. However\, this isn’t for everyone... Sorry! We’re on a mission to help as many people get out of debt as fast as possible\, see if we can help you by reviewing the information\, then decide if it’s a fit for you. After reviewing the information\, we get comments like\; “Why isn’t anyone talking more about this” or “Why haven’t I heard about this sooner”. Just think what life would be like being debt free? Would you put the money you usually paid out towards debt towards retirement\, or a 2nd vacation home\, a trip?? If you make over $100K a year and are paying extra every month to reduce your bills\, this is something you will want to know about! Frequently asked questions Q: Can you let me know about how much the monthly payments will be? Q: Can you let me know about how much the cost will be? Q: Is this plan for everyone?

My platform helps U.S. Veterans write down their Military Stories with the help of AI technology. I believe there’s a unique opportunity to help younger and older generations sharpen their writing\, technical\, and storytelling skills. Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming one of the most important tools of our time—if it isn’t already. In a class like mine\, we can help students use AI in ways that are both practical and meaningful to them. This course would cover: - The fundamentals of narrative structure and writing techniques. - How AI can assist with brainstorming\, editing\, and refining personal or historical narratives. - Practical writing skills\, alongside an introduction to the AI technology that is reshaping our world. Students will get hands-on experience with AI technology while strengthening their storytelling and writing skills.

Can I still use the Words of Veterans AI-assisted U.S. Veteran writing platform? I’m not tech savvy. Do I need technical skills? What does “AI-Assisted” mean? Is my story automatically made public? I have more questions. How can I contact you?
