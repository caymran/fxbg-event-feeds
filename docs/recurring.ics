DESCRIPTION:<p>Hand To God</p>\n\n<p>by Robert Askins</p>\n\n<p>February 5 – 15\, 2026</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas\, this riotous dark comedy features Jason\, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother\, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush\, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet\,Tyrone\, spews everyone’s deepest secrets\, creating rifts between Jason\, his peers\, his pastor\, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith\, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh)\, but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death\, depression\, alcoholism\, sexual guilt\, emotional repression\, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>February 5– 15</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays\, February 8 &amp\; 15 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview February 4</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords February 8</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Hand+To+God&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Feb+5%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHand+To+God%0A%0Aby+Robert+Askins%0A%0AFebruary+5+%E2%80%93+15%2C+2026%0A%0A+%0A%0AIn+the+bowels+of+a+church+basement+in+Texas%2C+this+riotous+dark+comedy+features+Jason%2C+a+timid+teenager+and+reluctant+recruit+to+a+Christian+Puppet+Ministry+run+by+his+mother%2C+Margery.+With+a+mouth+so+foul+it+would+make+a+sailor+blush%2C+Jason%E2%80%99s+fiendishly+loquacious+puppet%2CTyrone%2C+spews+everyone%E2%80%99s+deepest+secrets%2C+creating+rifts+between+Jason%2C+his+peers%2C+his+pastor%2C+and+his+mother.+A+provocative+and+hilariously+profound+exploration+of+human+nature+and+the+fragility+of+faith%2C+Hand+to+God+may+have+the+faint+of+heart+running+for+the+exits+%28while+stifling+a+laugh%29%2C+but+its+message+will+resonate+long+after+Tyrone+proclaims+his+ultimate+prophecy.%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CFuriously+funny+.+.+.+Askins%E2%80%99+most+impressive+talent+is+his+ability+to+make+us+laugh+while+juggling+those+big+themes+that+make+life+so+terrifying%3A+death%2C+depression%2C+alcoholism%2C+sexual+guilt%2C+emotional+repression%2C+religious+hypocrisy+and+the+eternal+battle+between+your+good+puppet+and+your+bad+puppet.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Variety%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s+loud+and+lewd+and+irreverent+and+howlingly+funny.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Washington+City+Paper+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AFebruary+5%E2%80%93+15%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays%2C+February+8+%26+15+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+February+4%0A%0AAfterWords+February+8%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fhand-to-god%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god

DESCRIPTION:<p>Henry V</p>\n\n<p>by William Shakespeare</p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19\, 2026\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p>History and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor\, duty\, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays April 12 &amp\; 19 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview April 8</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords April 12</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+William+Shakespeare%27s+Henry+V&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Apr+9%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHenry+V%0A%0Aby+William+Shakespeare%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%2C+2026%0A+%0A%0AHistory+and+drama+collide+in+this+beautifully+penned+work+that+explores+the+rise+of+a+brazen+and+intrepid+young+king+as+he+leads+his+ragtag+army+to+claim+the+French+crown.+Honor%2C+duty%2C+and+the+burdens+of+kingship+are+brought+to+the+forefront+in+many+of+Henry%E2%80%99s+inspiring+appeals+and+in+William+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+rich+and+vivid+portrayal+of+the+Battle+of+Agincourt.+One+of+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+most+famous+history+plays%2C+unmatched+in+capturing+the+essence+of+heroism+and+the+complexities+of+war%2C+Henry+V+is+as+much+an+unforgettable+and+timeless+story+of+transformation+and+triumph+as+a+cautious+reminder+of+the+costs+of+reckless+ambition.%0A+%0A%0A+%E2%80%9CA+coruscating+production+about+the+desperate+grasp+for+power%2C+and+how+it+does+no+man+or+country+any+good.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Guardian%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CThe+play+is+the+prototype+for+Hollywood+epics+about+heroic+leaders+who+do+not+shirk+the+bloody+risks+of+battle+themselves.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Chicago+Tribune%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays+April+12+%26+19+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+April+8%0A%0AAfterWords+April+12%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fwilliam-shakespeares-henry-v%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

DESCRIPTION:<p>Henry V</p>\n\n<p>by William Shakespeare</p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19\, 2026\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p>History and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor\, duty\, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays April 12 &amp\; 19 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview April 8</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords April 12</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+William+Shakespeare%27s+Henry+V&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Apr+10%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHenry+V%0A%0Aby+William+Shakespeare%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%2C+2026%0A+%0A%0AHistory+and+drama+collide+in+this+beautifully+penned+work+that+explores+the+rise+of+a+brazen+and+intrepid+young+king+as+he+leads+his+ragtag+army+to+claim+the+French+crown.+Honor%2C+duty%2C+and+the+burdens+of+kingship+are+brought+to+the+forefront+in+many+of+Henry%E2%80%99s+inspiring+appeals+and+in+William+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+rich+and+vivid+portrayal+of+the+Battle+of+Agincourt.+One+of+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+most+famous+history+plays%2C+unmatched+in+capturing+the+essence+of+heroism+and+the+complexities+of+war%2C+Henry+V+is+as+much+an+unforgettable+and+timeless+story+of+transformation+and+triumph+as+a+cautious+reminder+of+the+costs+of+reckless+ambition.%0A+%0A%0A+%E2%80%9CA+coruscating+production+about+the+desperate+grasp+for+power%2C+and+how+it+does+no+man+or+country+any+good.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Guardian%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CThe+play+is+the+prototype+for+Hollywood+epics+about+heroic+leaders+who+do+not+shirk+the+bloody+risks+of+battle+themselves.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Chicago+Tribune%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays+April+12+%26+19+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+April+8%0A%0AAfterWords+April+12%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fwilliam-shakespeares-henry-v%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays April 12 &amp\; 19 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview April 8</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords April 12</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+William+Shakespeare%27s+Henry+V&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Apr+11%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHenry+V%0A%0Aby+William+Shakespeare%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%2C+2026%0A+%0A%0AHistory+and+drama+collide+in+this+beautifully+penned+work+that+explores+the+rise+of+a+brazen+and+intrepid+young+king+as+he+leads+his+ragtag+army+to+claim+the+French+crown.+Honor%2C+duty%2C+and+the+burdens+of+kingship+are+brought+to+the+forefront+in+many+of+Henry%E2%80%99s+inspiring+appeals+and+in+William+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+rich+and+vivid+portrayal+of+the+Battle+of+Agincourt.+One+of+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+most+famous+history+plays%2C+unmatched+in+capturing+the+essence+of+heroism+and+the+complexities+of+war%2C+Henry+V+is+as+much+an+unforgettable+and+timeless+story+of+transformation+and+triumph+as+a+cautious+reminder+of+the+costs+of+reckless+ambition.%0A+%0A%0A+%E2%80%9CA+coruscating+production+about+the+desperate+grasp+for+power%2C+and+how+it+does+no+man+or+country+any+good.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Guardian%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CThe+play+is+the+prototype+for+Hollywood+epics+about+heroic+leaders+who+do+not+shirk+the+bloody+risks+of+battle+themselves.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Chicago+Tribune%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays+April+12+%26+19+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+April+8%0A%0AAfterWords+April+12%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fwilliam-shakespeares-henry-v%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

DESCRIPTION:<p>Hand To God</p>\n\n<p>by Robert Askins</p>\n\n<p>February 5 – 15\, 2026</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas\, this riotous dark comedy features Jason\, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother\, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush\, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet\,Tyrone\, spews everyone’s deepest secrets\, creating rifts between Jason\, his peers\, his pastor\, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith\, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh)\, but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death\, depression\, alcoholism\, sexual guilt\, emotional repression\, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>February 5– 15</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays\, February 8 &amp\; 15 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview February 4</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords February 8</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Hand+To+God&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Feb+7%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHand+To+God%0A%0Aby+Robert+Askins%0A%0AFebruary+5+%E2%80%93+15%2C+2026%0A%0A+%0A%0AIn+the+bowels+of+a+church+basement+in+Texas%2C+this+riotous+dark+comedy+features+Jason%2C+a+timid+teenager+and+reluctant+recruit+to+a+Christian+Puppet+Ministry+run+by+his+mother%2C+Margery.+With+a+mouth+so+foul+it+would+make+a+sailor+blush%2C+Jason%E2%80%99s+fiendishly+loquacious+puppet%2CTyrone%2C+spews+everyone%E2%80%99s+deepest+secrets%2C+creating+rifts+between+Jason%2C+his+peers%2C+his+pastor%2C+and+his+mother.+A+provocative+and+hilariously+profound+exploration+of+human+nature+and+the+fragility+of+faith%2C+Hand+to+God+may+have+the+faint+of+heart+running+for+the+exits+%28while+stifling+a+laugh%29%2C+but+its+message+will+resonate+long+after+Tyrone+proclaims+his+ultimate+prophecy.%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CFuriously+funny+.+.+.+Askins%E2%80%99+most+impressive+talent+is+his+ability+to+make+us+laugh+while+juggling+those+big+themes+that+make+life+so+terrifying%3A+death%2C+depression%2C+alcoholism%2C+sexual+guilt%2C+emotional+repression%2C+religious+hypocrisy+and+the+eternal+battle+between+your+good+puppet+and+your+bad+puppet.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Variety%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s+loud+and+lewd+and+irreverent+and+howlingly+funny.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Washington+City+Paper+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AFebruary+5%E2%80%93+15%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays%2C+February+8+%26+15+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+February+4%0A%0AAfterWords+February+8%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fhand-to-god%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god

One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays April 12 &amp\; 19 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview April 8</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords April 12</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+William+Shakespeare%27s+Henry+V&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Apr+19%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHenry+V%0A%0Aby+William+Shakespeare%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%2C+2026%0A+%0A%0AHistory+and+drama+collide+in+this+beautifully+penned+work+that+explores+the+rise+of+a+brazen+and+intrepid+young+king+as+he+leads+his+ragtag+army+to+claim+the+French+crown.+Honor%2C+duty%2C+and+the+burdens+of+kingship+are+brought+to+the+forefront+in+many+of+Henry%E2%80%99s+inspiring+appeals+and+in+William+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+rich+and+vivid+portrayal+of+the+Battle+of+Agincourt.+One+of+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+most+famous+history+plays%2C+unmatched+in+capturing+the+essence+of+heroism+and+the+complexities+of+war%2C+Henry+V+is+as+much+an+unforgettable+and+timeless+story+of+transformation+and+triumph+as+a+cautious+reminder+of+the+costs+of+reckless+ambition.%0A+%0A%0A+%E2%80%9CA+coruscating+production+about+the+desperate+grasp+for+power%2C+and+how+it+does+no+man+or+country+any+good.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Guardian%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CThe+play+is+the+prototype+for+Hollywood+epics+about+heroic+leaders+who+do+not+shirk+the+bloody+risks+of+battle+themselves.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Chicago+Tribune%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays+April+12+%26+19+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+April+8%0A%0AAfterWords+April+12%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fwilliam-shakespeares-henry-v%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

DESCRIPTION:<p>Hand To God</p>\n\n<p>by Robert Askins</p>\n\n<p>February 5 – 15\, 2026</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas\, this riotous dark comedy features Jason\, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother\, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush\, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet\,Tyrone\, spews everyone’s deepest secrets\, creating rifts between Jason\, his peers\, his pastor\, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith\, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh)\, but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death\, depression\, alcoholism\, sexual guilt\, emotional repression\, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>February 5– 15</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays\, February 8 &amp\; 15 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview February 4</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords February 8</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Hand+To+God&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Feb+8%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHand+To+God%0A%0Aby+Robert+Askins%0A%0AFebruary+5+%E2%80%93+15%2C+2026%0A%0A+%0A%0AIn+the+bowels+of+a+church+basement+in+Texas%2C+this+riotous+dark+comedy+features+Jason%2C+a+timid+teenager+and+reluctant+recruit+to+a+Christian+Puppet+Ministry+run+by+his+mother%2C+Margery.+With+a+mouth+so+foul+it+would+make+a+sailor+blush%2C+Jason%E2%80%99s+fiendishly+loquacious+puppet%2CTyrone%2C+spews+everyone%E2%80%99s+deepest+secrets%2C+creating+rifts+between+Jason%2C+his+peers%2C+his+pastor%2C+and+his+mother.+A+provocative+and+hilariously+profound+exploration+of+human+nature+and+the+fragility+of+faith%2C+Hand+to+God+may+have+the+faint+of+heart+running+for+the+exits+%28while+stifling+a+laugh%29%2C+but+its+message+will+resonate+long+after+Tyrone+proclaims+his+ultimate+prophecy.%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CFuriously+funny+.+.+.+Askins%E2%80%99+most+impressive+talent+is+his+ability+to+make+us+laugh+while+juggling+those+big+themes+that+make+life+so+terrifying%3A+death%2C+depression%2C+alcoholism%2C+sexual+guilt%2C+emotional+repression%2C+religious+hypocrisy+and+the+eternal+battle+between+your+good+puppet+and+your+bad+puppet.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Variety%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s+loud+and+lewd+and+irreverent+and+howlingly+funny.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Washington+City+Paper+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AFebruary+5%E2%80%93+15%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays%2C+February+8+%26+15+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+February+4%0A%0AAfterWords+February+8%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fhand-to-god%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god

DESCRIPTION:<p>Hand To God</p>\n\n<p>by Robert Askins</p>\n\n<p>February 5 – 15\, 2026</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas\, this riotous dark comedy features Jason\, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother\, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush\, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet\,Tyrone\, spews everyone’s deepest secrets\, creating rifts between Jason\, his peers\, his pastor\, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith\, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh)\, but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death\, depression\, alcoholism\, sexual guilt\, emotional repression\, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>February 5– 15</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays\, February 8 &amp\; 15 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview February 4</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords February 8</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Hand+To+God&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Feb+14%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHand+To+God%0A%0Aby+Robert+Askins%0A%0AFebruary+5+%E2%80%93+15%2C+2026%0A%0A+%0A%0AIn+the+bowels+of+a+church+basement+in+Texas%2C+this+riotous+dark+comedy+features+Jason%2C+a+timid+teenager+and+reluctant+recruit+to+a+Christian+Puppet+Ministry+run+by+his+mother%2C+Margery.+With+a+mouth+so+foul+it+would+make+a+sailor+blush%2C+Jason%E2%80%99s+fiendishly+loquacious+puppet%2CTyrone%2C+spews+everyone%E2%80%99s+deepest+secrets%2C+creating+rifts+between+Jason%2C+his+peers%2C+his+pastor%2C+and+his+mother.+A+provocative+and+hilariously+profound+exploration+of+human+nature+and+the+fragility+of+faith%2C+Hand+to+God+may+have+the+faint+of+heart+running+for+the+exits+%28while+stifling+a+laugh%29%2C+but+its+message+will+resonate+long+after+Tyrone+proclaims+his+ultimate+prophecy.%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CFuriously+funny+.+.+.+Askins%E2%80%99+most+impressive+talent+is+his+ability+to+make+us+laugh+while+juggling+those+big+themes+that+make+life+so+terrifying%3A+death%2C+depression%2C+alcoholism%2C+sexual+guilt%2C+emotional+repression%2C+religious+hypocrisy+and+the+eternal+battle+between+your+good+puppet+and+your+bad+puppet.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Variety%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s+loud+and+lewd+and+irreverent+and+howlingly+funny.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Washington+City+Paper+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AFebruary+5%E2%80%93+15%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays%2C+February+8+%26+15+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+February+4%0A%0AAfterWords+February+8%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fhand-to-god%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god

DESCRIPTION:<p>Henry V</p>\n\n<p>by William Shakespeare</p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19\, 2026\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p>History and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor\, duty\, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays April 12 &amp\; 19 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview April 8</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords April 12</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+William+Shakespeare%27s+Henry+V&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Apr+16%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHenry+V%0A%0Aby+William+Shakespeare%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%2C+2026%0A+%0A%0AHistory+and+drama+collide+in+this+beautifully+penned+work+that+explores+the+rise+of+a+brazen+and+intrepid+young+king+as+he+leads+his+ragtag+army+to+claim+the+French+crown.+Honor%2C+duty%2C+and+the+burdens+of+kingship+are+brought+to+the+forefront+in+many+of+Henry%E2%80%99s+inspiring+appeals+and+in+William+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+rich+and+vivid+portrayal+of+the+Battle+of+Agincourt.+One+of+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+most+famous+history+plays%2C+unmatched+in+capturing+the+essence+of+heroism+and+the+complexities+of+war%2C+Henry+V+is+as+much+an+unforgettable+and+timeless+story+of+transformation+and+triumph+as+a+cautious+reminder+of+the+costs+of+reckless+ambition.%0A+%0A%0A+%E2%80%9CA+coruscating+production+about+the+desperate+grasp+for+power%2C+and+how+it+does+no+man+or+country+any+good.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Guardian%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CThe+play+is+the+prototype+for+Hollywood+epics+about+heroic+leaders+who+do+not+shirk+the+bloody+risks+of+battle+themselves.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Chicago+Tribune%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays+April+12+%26+19+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+April+8%0A%0AAfterWords+April+12%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fwilliam-shakespeares-henry-v%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

DESCRIPTION:<p>Hand To God</p>\n\n<p>by Robert Askins</p>\n\n<p>February 5 – 15\, 2026</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas\, this riotous dark comedy features Jason\, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother\, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush\, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet\,Tyrone\, spews everyone’s deepest secrets\, creating rifts between Jason\, his peers\, his pastor\, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith\, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh)\, but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“Furiously funny . . .

One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>April 9 – 19</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays April 12 &amp\; 19 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview April 8</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords April 12</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+William+Shakespeare%27s+Henry+V&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Apr+12%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHenry+V%0A%0Aby+William+Shakespeare%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%2C+2026%0A+%0A%0AHistory+and+drama+collide+in+this+beautifully+penned+work+that+explores+the+rise+of+a+brazen+and+intrepid+young+king+as+he+leads+his+ragtag+army+to+claim+the+French+crown.+Honor%2C+duty%2C+and+the+burdens+of+kingship+are+brought+to+the+forefront+in+many+of+Henry%E2%80%99s+inspiring+appeals+and+in+William+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+rich+and+vivid+portrayal+of+the+Battle+of+Agincourt.+One+of+Shakespeare%E2%80%99s+most+famous+history+plays%2C+unmatched+in+capturing+the+essence+of+heroism+and+the+complexities+of+war%2C+Henry+V+is+as+much+an+unforgettable+and+timeless+story+of+transformation+and+triumph+as+a+cautious+reminder+of+the+costs+of+reckless+ambition.%0A+%0A%0A+%E2%80%9CA+coruscating+production+about+the+desperate+grasp+for+power%2C+and+how+it+does+no+man+or+country+any+good.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Guardian%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CThe+play+is+the+prototype+for+Hollywood+epics+about+heroic+leaders+who+do+not+shirk+the+bloody+risks+of+battle+themselves.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+The+Chicago+Tribune%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AApril+9+%E2%80%93+19%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays+April+12+%26+19+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+April+8%0A%0AAfterWords+April+12%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fwilliam-shakespeares-henry-v%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

DESCRIPTION:<p>Hand To God</p>\n\n<p>by Robert Askins</p>\n\n<p>February 5 – 15\, 2026</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas\, this riotous dark comedy features Jason\, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother\, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush\, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet\,Tyrone\, spews everyone’s deepest secrets\, creating rifts between Jason\, his peers\, his pastor\, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith\, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh)\, but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death\, depression\, alcoholism\, sexual guilt\, emotional repression\, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>February 5– 15</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays\, February 8 &amp\; 15 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview February 4</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords February 8</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Hand+To+God&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Feb+13%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHand+To+God%0A%0Aby+Robert+Askins%0A%0AFebruary+5+%E2%80%93+15%2C+2026%0A%0A+%0A%0AIn+the+bowels+of+a+church+basement+in+Texas%2C+this+riotous+dark+comedy+features+Jason%2C+a+timid+teenager+and+reluctant+recruit+to+a+Christian+Puppet+Ministry+run+by+his+mother%2C+Margery.+With+a+mouth+so+foul+it+would+make+a+sailor+blush%2C+Jason%E2%80%99s+fiendishly+loquacious+puppet%2CTyrone%2C+spews+everyone%E2%80%99s+deepest+secrets%2C+creating+rifts+between+Jason%2C+his+peers%2C+his+pastor%2C+and+his+mother.+A+provocative+and+hilariously+profound+exploration+of+human+nature+and+the+fragility+of+faith%2C+Hand+to+God+may+have+the+faint+of+heart+running+for+the+exits+%28while+stifling+a+laugh%29%2C+but+its+message+will+resonate+long+after+Tyrone+proclaims+his+ultimate+prophecy.%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CFuriously+funny+.+.+.+Askins%E2%80%99+most+impressive+talent+is+his+ability+to+make+us+laugh+while+juggling+those+big+themes+that+make+life+so+terrifying%3A+death%2C+depression%2C+alcoholism%2C+sexual+guilt%2C+emotional+repression%2C+religious+hypocrisy+and+the+eternal+battle+between+your+good+puppet+and+your+bad+puppet.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Variety%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s+loud+and+lewd+and+irreverent+and+howlingly+funny.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Washington+City+Paper+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AFebruary+5%E2%80%93+15%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays%2C+February+8+%26+15+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+February+4%0A%0AAfterWords+February+8%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fhand-to-god%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god

DESCRIPTION:<p>Hand To God</p>\n\n<p>by Robert Askins</p>\n\n<p>February 5 – 15\, 2026</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas\, this riotous dark comedy features Jason\, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother\, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush\, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet\,Tyrone\, spews everyone’s deepest secrets\, creating rifts between Jason\, his peers\, his pastor\, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith\, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh)\, but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death\, depression\, alcoholism\, sexual guilt\, emotional repression\, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>February 5– 15</p>\n\n<p>Thursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\n<br />Sundays\, February 8 &amp\; 15 at 2:00 pm</p>\n\n<p>Pay-What-You-Can Preview February 4</p>\n\n<p>AfterWords February 8</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god">View on site</a> | <a href="mailto:?subject=I+found+an+interesting+event%3A+Hand+To+God&amp\;body=I+found+an+interesting+event+you+may+like%3A%0A%0A%0ADate%3A+Feb+12%2C+2026%0A%0ADescription%3A%0AHand+To+God%0A%0Aby+Robert+Askins%0A%0AFebruary+5+%E2%80%93+15%2C+2026%0A%0A+%0A%0AIn+the+bowels+of+a+church+basement+in+Texas%2C+this+riotous+dark+comedy+features+Jason%2C+a+timid+teenager+and+reluctant+recruit+to+a+Christian+Puppet+Ministry+run+by+his+mother%2C+Margery.+With+a+mouth+so+foul+it+would+make+a+sailor+blush%2C+Jason%E2%80%99s+fiendishly+loquacious+puppet%2CTyrone%2C+spews+everyone%E2%80%99s+deepest+secrets%2C+creating+rifts+between+Jason%2C+his+peers%2C+his+pastor%2C+and+his+mother.+A+provocative+and+hilariously+profound+exploration+of+human+nature+and+the+fragility+of+faith%2C+Hand+to+God+may+have+the+faint+of+heart+running+for+the+exits+%28while+stifling+a+laugh%29%2C+but+its+message+will+resonate+long+after+Tyrone+proclaims+his+ultimate+prophecy.%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CFuriously+funny+.+.+.+Askins%E2%80%99+most+impressive+talent+is+his+ability+to+make+us+laugh+while+juggling+those+big+themes+that+make+life+so+terrifying%3A+death%2C+depression%2C+alcoholism%2C+sexual+guilt%2C+emotional+repression%2C+religious+hypocrisy+and+the+eternal+battle+between+your+good+puppet+and+your+bad+puppet.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Variety%0A%0A+%0A%0A%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s+loud+and+lewd+and+irreverent+and+howlingly+funny.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%94+Washington+City+Paper+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+%0A%0AFebruary+5%E2%80%93+15%0A%0AThursday-Saturday+at+7%3A30+pm%0ASundays%2C+February+8+%26+15+at+2%3A00+pm%0A%0APay-What-You-Can+Preview+February+4%0A%0AAfterWords+February+8%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fat.umw.edu%2Fevent%2Fhand-to-god%0A">Email this event</a></p>\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/hand-to-god
