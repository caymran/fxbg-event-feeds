X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Hand To God</p>

<p>by Robert Askins</p>

<p>February 5 – 15, 2026</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas, this riotous dark comedy features Jason, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet,Tyrone, spews everyone’s deepest secrets, creating rifts between Jason, his peers, his pastor, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh), but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death, depression, alcoholism, sexual guilt, emotional repression, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>

<p> </p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Henry V</p>

<p>by William Shakespeare</p>

<p>April 9 – 19, 2026
<br /> </p>

<p>History and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor, duty, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.
<br /> </p>

<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>

<p>book by John-Michael Tebelak</p>

<p>November 6 – 23, 2025
<br /> </p>

<p>Seeking answers in a world of chaos, a group of strangers heed the call of a prophet to ponder a string of parables speaking to life’s purpose and promise. So much more than just a retelling of the gospels, Stephen Schwartz’s (Wicked, Pippin) and John-Michael Tebelak’s exhilarating and vibrant Godspell delivers timely messages of love, compassion, and community. With a rock score and renewed story that speaks to today, Godspell showcases a spectrum of songs like “Day by Day,” “Learn Your Lessons Well,” and “All for the Best.” Join us for this inspiring and dynamic musical that offers hope in turbulent times.
<br /> </p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Hand To God</p>

<p>by Robert Askins</p>

<p>February 5 – 15, 2026</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas, this riotous dark comedy features Jason, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet,Tyrone, spews everyone’s deepest secrets, creating rifts between Jason, his peers, his pastor, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh), but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death, depression, alcoholism, sexual guilt, emotional repression, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>

<p>book by John-Michael Tebelak</p>

<p>November 6 – 23, 2025
<br /> </p>

<p>Seeking answers in a world of chaos, a group of strangers heed the call of a prophet to ponder a string of parables speaking to life’s purpose and promise. So much more than just a retelling of the gospels, Stephen Schwartz’s (Wicked, Pippin) and John-Michael Tebelak’s exhilarating and vibrant Godspell delivers timely messages of love, compassion, and community. With a rock score and renewed story that speaks to today, Godspell showcases a spectrum of songs like “Day by Day,” “Learn Your Lessons Well,” and “All for the Best.” Join us for this inspiring and dynamic musical that offers hope in turbulent times.

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Dial “M” for Murder</p>

<p>by Frederick Knott</p>

<p>adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher</p>

<p>September 18 – 28, 2025</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice hatches the perfect plan to murder his wife, Margot, and make off with her fortune. Plans take an unexpected turn when she kills her attacker in self-defense and the scheme unravels at the seams. Tony suddenly finds himself at the center of an investigation led by a cunning inspector and of all people, Margot’s lover. Expertly crafted by Frederick Knott, adapted for film by Alfred Hitchcock, and enhanced for the stage by Jeffrey Hatcher, Dial “M” for Murder is a riveting thriller that will keep you spellbound from lights up to the final curtain.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Hand To God</p>

<p>by Robert Askins</p>

<p>February 5 – 15, 2026</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas, this riotous dark comedy features Jason, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet,Tyrone, spews everyone’s deepest secrets, creating rifts between Jason, his peers, his pastor, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh), but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death, depression, alcoholism, sexual guilt, emotional repression, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Henry V</p>

<p>by William Shakespeare</p>

<p>April 9 – 19, 2026
<br /> </p>

<p>History and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor, duty, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.
<br /> </p>

<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>

DESCRIPTION:Henry V\nby William Shakespeare\nApril 9 – 19\, 2026\nHistory and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown.

One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n“A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian\n“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune\nApril 9 – 19\nThursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\nSundays April 12 & 19 at 2:00 pm\nPay-What-You-Can Preview April 8\nAfterWords April 12\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Hand To God</p>

<p>by Robert Askins</p>

<p>February 5 – 15, 2026</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas, this riotous dark comedy features Jason, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet,Tyrone, spews everyone’s deepest secrets, creating rifts between Jason, his peers, his pastor, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh), but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death, depression, alcoholism, sexual guilt, emotional repression, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Henry V</p>

<p>by William Shakespeare</p>

<p>April 9 – 19, 2026
<br /> </p>

<p>History and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor, duty, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.
<br /> </p>

<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Gari Melchers Home and Studio invites artists of all skill levels and mediums to participate in our Plein Air Days. On these unique days, artists are encouraged to create in our gardens, display their work in progress, and meet with other artists and visitors. The grounds will open early at 8:00 AM. The extended site hours for this event (8:00 AM – 10:00 AM) may be cancelled due to inclement weather. Gari Melchers Home and Studio will communicate any changes via social media.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Gari Melchers Home and Studio is open daily 10:00 AM- 5:00 PM. It is free to walk the grounds and gardens. There is an admission charge to tour the historic home and galleries.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The outdoor Plein Air Day event is free and open to the public. There is no fee for participating artists. Professional photographers using the site for client portrait sessions must follow our Photography Guidelines and site use fees.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>All participants are expected to follow these guidelines:</p>

<p>· Check-in and Check-out - All artists and visitors are required to check-in at the Visitor Center. The Visitor Center will remain open throughout the event so participants may have access to restrooms and water. The museum gates will close promptly at 5:00 PM. Artists are asked to check out to ensure all visitors are off the property at closing time.</p>

<p>· Be Courteous - Artists are welcome to work anywhere on the grounds outside, but must be respectful of the property and guests. Walkways should not be blocked. No standing or walking in flowerbeds or shrubbery. Do not move flower pots, benches, chairs, or any other lawn ornament. No climbing or sitting on gates, walls, fences, trees, statuary, buildings, and farm equipment. No attaching items to structures or vegetation. If an artist creates a potentially dangerous worksite or their medium poses a risk of destruction to the property, they will be asked to stop, relocate or leave.</p>

<p>· Be Prepared - Participants are responsible for all materials and tools required to do their work. On-site electricity is not available.</p>

<p>· Be Clean - Participants are asked to leave no trace. If the creative process may become messy, please plan to bring drop cloths. Artists should help maintain the cleanliness of the public restrooms. Restroom sinks may be used for minimal tool cleanup and handwashing. A dump bucket for paint water and a trash can will be available at the Visitor Center.</p>

<p>· Be Kind and Considerate - Participants are asked to be respectful of other artists and members of the public who may stop to observe their work. We ask guests to cultivate a pleasant experience for all participants. Artists are asked to maintain a small footprint to ensure access for all. Artists should plan to work within no more than a 6’x6’ workspace.</p>

<p>· No Sales - Artists are encouraged to promote themselves and their work; however, they are not permitted to sell their items on site. Artists may bring promotional materials (business cards, QR codes, etc.) that will help guests find them online or in local galleries/studios.</p>

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Henry V</p>

<p>by William Shakespeare</p>

<p>April 9 – 19, 2026
<br /> </p>

<p>History and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor, duty, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.
<br /> </p>

<p> “A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune</p>

<p>book by John-Michael Tebelak</p>

<p>November 6 – 23, 2025

<p>Seeking answers in a world of chaos, a group of strangers heed the call of a prophet to ponder a string of parables speaking to life’s purpose and promise. So much more than just a retelling of the gospels, Stephen Schwartz’s (Wicked, Pippin) and John-Michael Tebelak’s exhilarating and vibrant Godspell delivers timely messages of love, compassion, and community. With a rock score and renewed story that speaks to today, Godspell showcases a spectrum of songs like “Day by Day,” “Learn Your Lessons Well,” and “All for the Best.” Join us for this inspiring and dynamic musical that offers hope in turbulent times.

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Hand To God</p>

<p>by Robert Askins</p>

<p>February 5 – 15, 2026</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas, this riotous dark comedy features Jason, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet,Tyrone, spews everyone’s deepest secrets, creating rifts between Jason, his peers, his pastor, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh), but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death, depression, alcoholism, sexual guilt, emotional repression, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>

DESCRIPTION:Henry V\nby William Shakespeare\nApril 9 – 19\, 2026\nHistory and drama collide in this beautifully penned work that explores the rise of a brazen and intrepid young king as he leads his ragtag army to claim the French crown. Honor\, duty\, and the burdens of kingship are brought to the forefront in many of Henry’s inspiring appeals and in William Shakespeare’s rich and vivid portrayal of the Battle of Agincourt. One of Shakespeare’s most famous history plays\, unmatched in capturing the essence of heroism and the complexities of war\, Henry V is as much an unforgettable and timeless story of transformation and triumph as a cautious reminder of the costs of reckless ambition.\n“A coruscating production about the desperate grasp for power\, and how it does no man or country any good.” — The Guardian\n“The play is the prototype for Hollywood epics about heroic leaders who do not shirk the bloody risks of battle themselves.” — The Chicago Tribune\nApril 9 – 19\nThursday-Saturday at 7:30 pm\nSundays April 12 & 19 at 2:00 pm\nPay-What-You-Can Preview April 8\nAfterWords April 12\nhttps://at.umw.edu/event/william-shakespeares-henry-v

<p>book by John-Michael Tebelak</p>

<p>November 6 – 23, 2025

<p>Seeking answers in a world of chaos, a group of strangers heed the call of a prophet to ponder a string of parables speaking to life’s purpose and promise. So much more than just a retelling of the gospels, Stephen Schwartz’s (Wicked, Pippin) and John-Michael Tebelak’s exhilarating and vibrant Godspell delivers timely messages of love, compassion, and community. With a rock score and renewed story that speaks to today, Godspell showcases a spectrum of songs like “Day by Day,” “Learn Your Lessons Well,” and “All for the Best.” Join us for this inspiring and dynamic musical that offers hope in turbulent times.

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=t,e,x,t,/,h,t,m,l:<p>Hand To God</p>

<p>by Robert Askins</p>

<p>February 5 – 15, 2026</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the bowels of a church basement in Texas, this riotous dark comedy features Jason, a timid teenager and reluctant recruit to a Christian Puppet Ministry run by his mother, Margery. With a mouth so foul it would make a sailor blush, Jason’s fiendishly loquacious puppet,Tyrone, spews everyone’s deepest secrets, creating rifts between Jason, his peers, his pastor, and his mother. A provocative and hilariously profound exploration of human nature and the fragility of faith, Hand to God may have the faint of heart running for the exits (while stifling a laugh), but its message will resonate long after Tyrone proclaims his ultimate prophecy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Furiously funny . . . Askins’ most impressive talent is his ability to make us laugh while juggling those big themes that make life so terrifying: death, depression, alcoholism, sexual guilt, emotional repression, religious hypocrisy and the eternal battle between your good puppet and your bad puppet.” — Variety</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s loud and lewd and irreverent and howlingly funny.” — Washington City Paper </p>
