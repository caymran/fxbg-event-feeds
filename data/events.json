By Scott Richards Follow Discover a game-changing strategy to conquer debt without spending more each month! Location Fredericksburg 123 Main St Fredericksburg, VA 22401 Get directions Good to know Highlights In person Highlights In person About this event Business \u2022 Finance Do you owe money to any creditors? Are you working to pay off debts like a mortgage, maybe a student loan, a car loan, or credit cards? Are the never-ending payments creating immense stress and anxiety in your life? Would having zero debt provide you with peace of mind and a less stressful life? Of course it would, then you need to do something about it! We have a plan that gets you out of debt faster than the way you\u2019re currently paying your bills, and we\u2019d like to share it with you. It\u2019s free to see, and no obligation to do anything Register and in the confirmation email will be a link to the information that describes the program. This is NOT credit consolidation, debt relief or anything that affects your credit. You\u2019ll still pay off your debts, but using a modified snowball approach. You can usually do it much faster than just paying extra on your debt. We\u2019ll show you how, without changing your monthly spend. However, this isn\u2019t for everyone... Sorry! We\u2019re on a mission to help as many people get out of debt as fast as possible, see if we can help you by reviewing the information, then decide if it\u2019s a fit for you. After reviewing the information, we get comments like; \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone talking more about this\u201d or \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard about this sooner\u201d. Just think what life would be like being debt free? Would you put the money you usually paid out towards debt towards retirement, or a 2nd vacation home, a trip?? If you make over $100K a year and are paying extra every month to reduce your bills, this is something you will want to know about! Frequently asked questions Q: Can you let me know about how much the monthly payments will be? Q: Can you let me know about how much the cost will be? Q: Is this plan for everyone?
